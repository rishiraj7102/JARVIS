# Python-Project
This is a project based on a virtual assistant named JARVIS in Python.
A virtual assistant that can perform activities like opening applications, websites , responding to basic and many more thing  questions through speech recognition and text-to-speech engines in Python . I am adding more functionality frequently to make the assistant more dynamic.
